## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- ARIA Accessible
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Css library
- Vanila javaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to build responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and make them more accessible. I improved my skills in using semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and Tailwind CSS for rapid styling. I also gained experience in implementing interactive states and optimizing user experience across devices. I too learned how to make the product page more accessible and practiced a lot of this page logic.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) â€“ Helped me understand how to use responsive utility classes and how to apply spacing, typography, and custom colors effectively.
